#ðŸ§¾ About My Project
This project analyzes temperature-related feedback using basic Python and machine learning to predict sentiment and suggest suitable activities.

âœ… What I Used in the Project
1. pandas â€“ for data loading and handling
2.sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression â€“ for training ML models
3.sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder â€“ to convert text labels to numbers
4.Basic Python functions â€“ for text cleaning (lowercase, remove punctuation)
5.Console-based app â€“ built using simple input() and print() functions
6.Two ML models: Sentiment prediction (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
7.Participant prediction (based on budget, department, event type)

ðŸ”¹ Use of This Project
This project predicts people's sentiment from weather feedback and recommends suitable activities based on temperature and weather using basic machine learning techniques
