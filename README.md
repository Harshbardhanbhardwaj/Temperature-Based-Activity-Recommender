ðŸ§¾ About My Project
This project analyzes temperature-related feedback using basic Python and machine learning to predict sentiment and suggest suitable activities.

âœ… What I Used in the Project
pandas â€“ for data loading and handling

sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression â€“ for training ML models

sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder â€“ to convert text labels to numbers

Basic Python functions â€“ for text cleaning (lowercase, remove punctuation)

Console-based app â€“ built using simple input() and print() functions

Two ML models: Sentiment prediction (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

Participant prediction (based on budget, department, event type)

ðŸ”¹ Use of This Project
This project predicts people's sentiment from weather feedback and recommends suitable activities based on temperature and weather using basic machine learning techniques
